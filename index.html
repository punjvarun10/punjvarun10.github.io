            <h3>AEM MSM Solution made Riverbed's multilingual sites easy</h3>
            <p>In late 2015, Riverbed, an American IT company that develops 
              products to improve application performance  across wide area networks 
              (WANs) using WAN Optimization, started using Adobe Experience Cloud 
              Platform  for their customer facing website www.riverbed.com. AEM has 
              been especially helpful to create a  multinational and multilingual 
              website and manage the website content by their authoring team across 
              the  globe.</p>
            <h4>Multi Site Manager (MSM) helped create the multinational website's content</h4>
            <p>In the early 2010s, the increasing need for a content management 
              solution to manage their  multilingual website was a primary driving 
              factor for Riverbed; and at the end of 2015, they chose  AEM Sites and 
              migrated their outdated legacy site content. Adobe's Multi Site Manager 
              (MSM)  helped them to create a blueprint English site and 3 regional 
              sites and 17 different country based  sites of which 10 of them were 
              non-English and required translation of the entire site's content.</p>
            <h4><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Lack of content sync configuration for multi valued properties </h4>
            <p>A set of rollout configurations were created to meet Riverbed's 
              content synchronization needs  using OOTB sync actions. However, most of
              the components were found using a handful of  multivalued properties 
              for which there are no OOTB sync actions found that can be used. It  
              resulted in the content of the multivalued properties untouched by the 
              rollout, requiring manual  editing after rollout by authoring team. A 
              need to automate this became a crucial need for  Riverbed.</p>
            <h4><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Multilingual sites that requires content translation</h4>
            <p>Of the various sites created using MSM, there were 10 sites 
              required translation of the entire site  content from English to local 
              language. In addition to the website content, a set of property values  
              of their DAM assets' and i18n translator keys required translation as 
              well. It became vital to find a  translation provider which could help 
              Riverbed to meet  these needs as  seamlessly as  possible.</p>
            <h4><strong>Challenge 3:</strong> Need for sophisticated content approval process</h4>
            <p>Riverbed's authoring team was spread out across the globe with 
              different permission levels on  operating over the content such as 
              approver, author, contributor etc. The regional sites and  country based
              sites required restricted access to the respective site(s). The default
              users and  grouping mechanism were not sufficient to achieve a 
              controlled content flow from author to  publish or live site.</p>
            <h4><strong>Solutions:</strong> Custom MSM Configurations, Translation.com for translation and  AEM user permissioning and workflows</h4>
            <p>In order to overcome the first challenge, a custom 
              synchronization action design was needed to be  developed by extending 
              the Multi Site Manager. Adobe documentation has the basics of how to do 
              the same, using which a custom live action synchronization was created 
              similar to the OOTB action  for properties i.e. editProperties for the 
              multivalued properties, after which a sweep of every existing  multi 
              valued property names across the code base was performed to collect the 
              list and add it to the  configuration once the custom action is in 
              place. This enabled the content rollout auto update the  content of 
              multivalued properties across  the site.</p>
            <h4><strong>Results:</strong> Significant gains in content rollouts, translational efforts and simplified  content lifecycle.</h4>
            <p>With the default rollout taking care of the multivalued 
              properties, the authoring experience is much  improved. Due to that, the
              manual overhead of fixing content after rollout was reduced to nothing.
              This resulted in quick turnover of rollout of content upon change in 
              the master site content to the  child sites.</p>
            <p>The global link plugin made the translation of the site content, 
              asset metadata content and the i18n  keys/labels possible and seamless 
              with mass requests made using the adaptor in the author. The  review of 
              the resulted content was quicker and there were very little to no manual
              updates required  by the authors after completion of the translation, 
              hence the turnover of the content update in  English  site to 
              non-English  site in real time was  achieved  quicker as desired.</p>
            <p>The custom workflows and the segregated user group permissioning 
              made the content activation  process simpler and quicker. The email 
              notification steps were used to reach out to the respective  users for 
              approval or rejection. The siteadmin changes resulted in reduced 
              training needs for the  authors to get their content update to the live 
              site.</p>

            <h3>AEM Personalization improves AT&amp;T's marketing focus</h3>
            <p>Since 2011, AT&amp;T, the largest telecommunication provider in 
              the United States, has been using Adobe  Platform for their customer 
              facing website www.att.com. AEM has been especially helpful to create, 
              manage  content by the merchandising team on a daily basis to meet their
              marketing needs much better than ever  before.</p>
            <h4>Targeted Content using Personalization</h4>
            <p>With the everyday competitions from the other telecom providers 
              in the country, AT&amp;T  finds the need to update their website content
              with advertisements, offers, promotions, campaigns,  discount programs 
              and such on a regular basis. These programs are usually targeted based 
              on the  customer profile or the geography. When AT&amp;T started with 
              the AEM's personalization features at  first, they customized their 
              personalization profile based on the customer profile received from  
              their backend. If the customer is not logged in, then the geographical 
              profile supplied from the CDN  provider is used to target the content.</p>
            <h4><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Marketing campaigns were either based on user profile or the  geography</h4>
            <p>AT&amp;T's merchandising team realized it later that current 
              personalization design in place, restricted  them from using campaigns 
              in combination of profiles from both profiles. When they tried to create
              segmentation rules using user profile attributes and geographical 
              profile which are not common or  relatable to the user  profile, they 
              hit a roadblock.</p>
            <h4><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Repetitive development need for each new profile attribute added </h4>
            <p>Whenever there is a new attribute added to the user or 
              geographical profile, there was a repeated  development required to 
              create a trait for each one of them in order to make them available for 
              designing the segmentation rules.</p>
            <p>As a result of this constantly growing profile attributes, the 
              sidekick and the codebase started  growing with the duplicate trait 
              components. This resulted in poor authoring experience and  increased 
              training to the authors to identify newly added traits.</p>
            <h4><strong>Solution:</strong> Combine geo-profile and user profile &amp; generalize traits</h4>
            <p>In order to overcome both the challenges, AT&amp;T developed an 
              OSGi configuration that will hold all  the geographical and user profile
              attributes along with the type of the attribute value such as string,  
              number, float, boolean etc.</p>
            <p>For the first challenge, the client context profile building 
              feature is extended to combine the user  profile and geographical 
              profile attributes together and persist in the local storage of the 
              browser for  the content targeting feature to use against the 
              segmentation rules. This made the segmentation  rules with combined 
              attribute possible in real-time.</p>
            <p>For the second challenge, a generalized trait component is 
              created which can choose between the  user profile and geo-profile to 
              list the attributes and possible conditions from the OSGi configuration 
              created earlier.</p>
            <h4><strong>Results:</strong> Significant gains in productivity, content targeting, and reduced  training needs and development efforts.</h4>
            <p>With the combination made  available as  a  single profile, 
              marketing team is  now able  to create
              segmentation rules combining the profile attributes from user 
              profile and geo-profile from CDN. This  enhanced  content targeting in a
              much  better way led to a  broader customer base.</p>
            <p>Whenever there is a new attribute added to either of these 
              profiles, marketing team is able to  cooperate with the operations team 
              to add the newly added attribute to either of these profiles and  made 
              them available for segmentation in just a matter of minutes compared to 
              days as it used to be  before relying on code  change  and  upcoming 
              releases.</p>
            <p>The authoring experience for creating/editing segmentation rules 
              is better now with an intuitive  sidekick with reduced number of traits 
              and a single generalized trait that can be used for any of the  
              attributes. This resulted in cut down of training to the authors as 
              there are no new traits added for  every attribute.</p>
